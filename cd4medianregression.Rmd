We refer the reader to the cd4+ data in Supplemental Table #2. However, here is a linear regression to show the significance of the increase.

Read in median CD4+ count from Supp Table 1
```{r read}
cd4median <- read.csv(file = "medcd4.csv", header = TRUE)
cd4fit <- lm(cd4 ~ year, data = cd4median)
summary(cd4fit)
plot(cd4fit)
require(car)
qqPlot(cd4fit)
```
